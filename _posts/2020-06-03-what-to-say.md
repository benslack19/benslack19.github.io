"I’m trying to write a blog entry but I don’t know where to start. I’ve thought about race for so long."

"The heart is always a good place."

I saw that reply from Brian with a silent chuckle at its cheesiness but also an acknowledgement that he is right. What is in my heart?

I did not watch the video or stare long at an image of the George Floyd incident. I did not have to. I think I only looked at a photograph for a few seconds at most. But I can't stop seeing it in my mind. The casual look of the officer's face as Floyd is treated as an object. The sheer indignity. Why wouldn't a rational response be anything but horrified? Or disgusted? Or angry?

A few days ago, I thought about what Floyd must have felt in the moment, both physically and emotionally. I tried to mimic just *a little bit* of what he felt. You can try do the following yourself.

Lay face down on your bed. This may not be a big deal if you sleep on their stomach. But I'm a back and side sleeper. I was uncomfortable within a few seconds. Now get off your bed and do the same on a hard floor (a kitchen or bathroom if most of your floors have carpet).

At this point, do a self-check of your emotions. How do you feel? Lying on a hard floor was already uncomfortable but I also started to feel embarrassed. And this *was alone and in the comfort of home*. Let's keep going.

While you're on the floor, stomach down, notice your arms. Your arms will instinctively adjust so you can breathe and be more comfortable. Now place your hands and arms behind your back. Remember Floyd was handcuffed. (Again, this all started merely over a \$20 bill. How this would even lead to an arrest is mind-boggling on its own.)

How do you feel now? Just putting my arms behind my back made it harder to breathe within a few seconds. Let's keep going.

While still lying face down on the floor, take one hand (doesn't matter which), and push down hard on the back of your own neck. If you don't push down very hard, it might feel like a massage. But add a little more pressure and it was painful and annoying within a few seconds. I'm doing this again, but this time sitting upright. I did not want to press down on my neck for more than ten seconds. Remember, you're *doing this to yourself.* 

Now let's think again about the Chauvin-Floyd incident. Floyd was not in his own home. He was not voluntarily lying on a kitchen floor. Chauvin forced Floyd to lay handcuffed and face down on a street. Floyd was not pressing down on his own neck for a few seconds. Chauvin used his weight to drive his knee onto Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes.

Floyd was not alone, feeling embarrased. His dignity was robbed.

Floyd did not have trouble breathing. He was being suffocated to death.

Why wouldn't a rational response be anything but horrified? Or disgusted? Or angry?
