title: "Extending the chain"
---

Last month, I [wrote](https://benslack19.github.io/the-chain/) about how I aimed to make daily contributions towards my goals, no matter how small. Not surprisingly, it has been challenging. Nevertheless, I *have* maintained a chart where I can at least see what goals I've been able to contribute to in the last month.

Where have I spent most time? It's been the subject that most interests me and what I do first thing in the morning: statistics and Bayesian data analysis.  Where have I fallen behind? The area of tool development and in writing. I feel like the tool development has lead to the lowest ROI currently. It is probably good that I don't spend too much time there. But writing I can maintain. I continue to think of topics and will make additional entries soon.
