title: Improving my writing 
toc: true

Writing well is a skill that I will prioritize. I have underrated writing as part of data scientist's toolkit. I expect to reap benefits personally and professionally as I improve my writing. I remember once hearing that good writing also means good thinking. I have learned that a well thought out project is much more effective than rushing in with good tools but addressing an unimportant question.

I've tried to improve my writing before but I dealt with writer's block and made careless errors when I overcame it. I decided as a New Year's resolution to be more consistent in writing and be more strategic in improving. To be more consistent, I will simply write more here. To be more strategic, I am taking a Udemy class called [Writing With Flair](https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-with-flair-how-to-become-an-exceptional-writer/learn/lecture/1131432?start=0#overview).

I am only a few lectures in but I've already started to incorporate some of his lessons.

I liked his discussion of mindsets:
- Write with integrity (be real)
- Yearn to connect (think from reader's point of view)
- Know your intent
- Aspire for beauty
- Don't be obsessed with perfection
- Balance the ingredients of simplicity, clarity, elegance, and evocativeness

He encouraged us to think of these ingredients like cooking. Do not be dogmatic about them individually but prioritize for the sentence's purpose.
- Simplicity: shorten words and sentences
- Clarity: enhance understanding
- Elegance: write gracefully with nice sentence rhythms
- Evocativeness: avoid cliches, give writing a more interesting tone

With this in mind, I can start to formulate a game plan for my posts, emails, research papers, etc. Thus far, my priorities in order are:

1. **Establish your purpose.** Is it to inform, persuade, entertain, or inspire? Most of my posts here will be to inform, but I sometimes unconsciously added other purposes. In retrospect, this was a distraction and lead to unnecessary time lost. (I was struck by how similar this is to what I learned in Toastmasters, a summary of which is shown [here](https://ezinearticles.com/?Four-Basic-Speech-Types:-Do-You-Want-to-Persuade,-Inform,-Inspire-or-Entertain?&id=5823240).
2. **Get ideas out and avoid writerâ€™s block.** Vomit your thoughts and don't be afraid to et others see a rough version, provided that time sensitivity is most important.
3. **Aim for simplicity.** Start editing by striking out unneeded words and sentences.
4. **Make it clear.** *Notes will be added when this section is completed.*
5. **Edit for elegance.** *Notes will be added when this section is completed.*
6. **Make it evocative.** *Notes will be added when this section is completed.*

To facilitate timeliness and avoid writer's block, I will commit a public copy of my post every 25-30 min. No exceptions. If it is a work-related email, communication can be even more time sensitive. But since emails can be the primary impression that others make of you (sometimes even the sole impression) it is critical to balance time-sensitivity with writing quality. A nice summary is the Elite Writers Checklist pdf provided in the class.
