title: Improving my writing 
toc: true
---

Writing well is a skill that I will prioritize. I have underrated writing as part of data scientist's toolkit. I expect to reap benefits personally and professionally as I improve my writing. I remember once hearing that good writing also means good thinking. I have found that a well-planned and thought out project is a much higher priority than charging into something with good tools but addressing a question that is not important.


It is something that I've tried to improve before but I still found myself dealing with writer's block and making careless errors. I decided as a New Year's resolution to be more consistent writing and be more strategic in improving. To be more consistent, I will write more here. To be more strategic, I am taking a class via Udemy called [Writing With Flair](https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-with-flair-how-to-become-an-exceptional-writer/learn/lecture/1131432?start=0#overview).

I am only a few lectures in but I already feel like I have a game plan for any of my posts, emails, research papers, etc.


My formula, aiming for timely writing. Priorities are, in the following order, get ideas out, make writing simpler, then re-write for clarity, elegance, and evocativeness.

1. Vomit ideas to avoid writerâ€™s block. Make it rough.
2. Smooth over after a paragraph. Make it simple.
3. Commit or save a copy every 25-30 min. No exceptions.
4. Continue to learn.



Know the purpose (similar to Toastmasters)
inform, persuade, entertain, inspire

Mindsets:
Write with integrity (be real)
Yearn to connect (think from reader's point of view)
Know your intent
Aspire for beauty
Balance the ingredients like an artist
Don't be obsessed with perfection


Think of writing like cooking with the main ingredients being:
-simplicity: shorten words and sentences
-clarity: enhance understanding
-elegance: write gracefully with nice sentence rhythms
-evocativeness: avoid cliches, give writing a more interesting tone
