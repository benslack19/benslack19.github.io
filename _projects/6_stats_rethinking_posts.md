I haven't been shy about being a [fan](https://media.giphy.com/media/KhdQ2Ia3FJuKs/giphy.gif) of [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Dr. Richard McElreath. Reading the book, following lectures, and [doing problems](https://media.giphy.com/media/eChf44Gyj2VrO/giphy.gif), has helped me be more comfortable with statistical concepts that previously went [over my head](https://media.giphy.com/media/THua3iQuHfw4g/giphy.gif).

One of the things that helped me learn was writing and coding out solutions. These posts may have been problems directly from the book. Other times I went down rabbit holes stemming from my own curiosity. I'm compiling the posts here to help those who may be going through the course or learning [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/). The order below is intended to be more logical for learning than my [blog post page](https://benslack19.github.io/year-archive/) which shows posts in reverse chronological order.

**Bayesian statistics-related posts before Statistical Rethinking**
1. [An intro to Bayes' theorem with Bertrand’s box paradox](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/a-bertrands-box/)

2. [Bayes-ball part 1](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/b-bayes-ball/)

3. [Bayes-ball part 2](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/prior-and-beta/)

4. [Bayes-ball part 3](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/credible-interval-and-math/)

**Posts related to Statistical Rethinking**

5. [Prior, prior predictive, likelihood, posterior, and posterior predictive](https://benslack19.github.io/prior-likelihood-posterior-predictive/)]

6. [Running models forwards and backwards](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/stats_rethinking_ch03_sim4blog_part1/)

7. [Correlated data, different DAGs](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/stats_rethinking_corr_diffDAGs/)

8. [Linear regression part 1: an intro to PyMC objects](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/pymc-linreg-entry01/)

9. [Linear regression part 2: understanding the posterior distribution](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/pymc-linreg_entry02/)

10. [Linear regression part 3: predicting an average outcome](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/pymc-linreg_entry03/)

11. [Linear regression part 4: predicting an actual outcome](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/pymc-linreg_entry04/)

12. [Multilevel modeling with binomial GLM](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/multilevel_modeling_01/)

13. [Exploring multilevel modeling failure](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/diagnosing-a-model/)

14. [Escaping the Devil’s Funnel](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/devilsfunnel_cnc_param/)

15. [Weird ways that covariance matrices are made](https://benslack19.github.io/data%20science/statistics/cov_matrix_weirdness/)

Of course, there's still [more for me to learn](https://media.giphy.com/media/miz4vcp6teDBXNWhF8/giphy.gif) and these posts aren't perfect. The image shown above is from a post on diagnosing model failure, which was in one of the later lessons of the book. I wanted to highlight it because "failure" is necessary for learning.

I'd welcome feedback at ben.lacar AT gmail.com.
