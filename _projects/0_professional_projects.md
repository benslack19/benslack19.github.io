The following are examples of external-facing collateral that I produced through my applications, bioinformatics scientist, and machine learning researcher roles in industry. My data science tools include bash scripts, Python, and R to develop pipelines, wrangle data, and create analysis visualizations. I authored papers, presentations, and posters for these and other projects.

**Single-Cell Stranded Total RNA Sequencing**$^1$

We adapted a method to be used in our instruments to obtain poly(A) and non-poly(A) RNA at the single-cell level. This provides our customers with a more comprehensive understanding of cellular profiles.

**Processing flow-sorted cells for C1 mRNA-seq applications**$^1$

Cryopreservation and flow sorting have become necessary steps upstream of single-cell processing. We evaluated the effect of serum on the recovery of cryopreserved cells prior to processing on the C1 to facilitate customer success.

**Advanta CFTR NGS Library Prep**$^1$

Cystic fibrosis profiling is a laboratory test common for new parents in some demographics. We developed a library prepraration assay that increases the scale of samples that can be tested.

**Juno mRNA-Seq Library Prep**$^1$

Bulk RNA-seq is one of the most popular sequencing methods in academic and commercial labs. We developed an assay that increases the scale of samples that can be prepared.

**Juno mRNA-Seq Library Prep**$^2$

Mass spectroscopy is the gold standard method to obtain unbiased proteomics. The nanoparticle system developed at Seer increases the throughput of samples and depth of proteomic coverage.
