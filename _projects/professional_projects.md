The following are examples of external-facing collateral that I produced through my applications and bioinformatics scientist roles. My data science tools include bash scripts, Python, and R to develop pipelines, wrangle data, and create analysis visualizations. I author papers, presentations, and posters for these and other projects.


**Single-Cell Stranded Total RNA Sequencing**

We adapted a method to be used in our instruments to obtain poly(A) and non-poly(A) RNA at the single-cell level. This provides our customers with a more comprehensive understanding of cellular profiles.

**Processing flow-sorted cells for C1 mRNA-seq applications**

Cryopreservation and flow sorting have become necessary steps upstream of single-cell processing. We evaluated the effect of serum on the recovery of cryopreserved cells prior to processing on the C1 to facilitate customer success.

**Advanta CFTR NGS Library Prep**

Cystic fibrosis profiling is a laboratory test common for new parents in some demographics. We developed a library prepraration assay that increases the scale of samples that can be tested.

**Juno mRNA-Seq Library Prep**

Bulk RNA-seq is one of the most popular sequencing methods in academic and commercial labs. We developed an assay that increases the scale of samples that can be prepared.
