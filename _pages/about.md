I'm a bioinformatics scientist, data scientist, neuroscientist, and part-time educator.

I studied biochemistry at UCLA, earned my Ph.D. in neuroscience at Yale University, and performed postdoctoral neuroscience research at the Salk Institute. My research on neural plasticity was fueled by my interests in learning. My academic work included investigation of signaling mechanisms in a neurogenic niche and the molecular changes that occur within neurons in response to an organism having new experiences. In parallel to my postdoc work, I served as a consultant to educators interested in knowing more about the brain. A list of my publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wGG8V78AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My academic work led to a life science industry position. I initially worked as an applications scientist, a multi-faceted role that included generating customer-facing data analyses, educating internal staff and customers, and serving as a technical liasion for product management. I am now a bioinformatics scientist, supporting R&D efforts. Examples of external-facing data content I generated can be found [here](https://benslack19.github.io/projects/professional_projects/).

I have extensive experience performing independent research, analyzing and interpreting complex data sets, optimizing data analysis, and communicating my results through oral and written presentations. A glance over my shoulder at work and you'll likely see open windows of a Linux terminal, a Python Jupiter notebook, or RStudio.

In my spare time, I can be found surfing, hiking, or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California. Mexican food is my weakness. I can be reached at ben.lacar AT gmail.com.
