I'm a data scientist, bioinformatics scientist, neuroscientist, and part-time educator.

I studied biochemistry at UCLA, earned my Ph.D. in neuroscience at Yale University, and performed postdoctoral research at the Salk Institute. My research on neural plasticity was fueled by my interests in learning. My academic work included investigation of signaling mechanisms in a neurogenic niche and the molecular changes that occur within neurons in response to an organism having new experiences. In parallel to my postdoc work, I served as a consultant to educators interested in knowing more about the brain. A list of my publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wGG8V78AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My academic work led to industry positions. I initially worked in life science as an applications scientist, a multi-faceted role that included generating customer-facing data analyses, educating internal staff and customers, and serving as a technical liasion for product management. From there, I served as a bioinformatics scientist, supporting R&D efforts. Examples of external-facing data content I generated can be found [here](https://benslack19.github.io/projects/5_professional_projects/). I am now a fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com) where I am seeking to transition to the tech industry. 

I have extensive experience performing independent research, analyzing and interpreting complex data sets, optimizing data analysis, and communicating my results through oral and written presentations. A glance over my shoulder at work and you'll likely see open windows of a Linux terminal, a Python Jupyter notebook, or RStudio.

In my spare time, I can be found surfing, hiking, or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California. Mexican food is my weakness. My github handle is a shoutout to [my childhood favorite sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball); "slack" comes from a nickname that my teammate's gave me and "19" is an homage to [my favorite player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gwynn).
