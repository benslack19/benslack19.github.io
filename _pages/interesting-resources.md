This is a running list of interesting resources I've liked in no particular order.

| Resource | Comment  |
| --- |  --- | 
| [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) | The name is appropriate. This book completely changed how I think of statistics. |
| [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) | An oft-cited, classic resource for machine learning. |
| [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/index.html) | I've only skimmed this but the explanations are excellent. |
| [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) | A casual intro to causal inference.  |
| [Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/) | Nice, practical reference on causal inference. |
| [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) | Arguably the godfather of Bayesian data analysis books. Haven't gone too deep into it, but it has more technical detail than Statistical Rethinking. |
