<img src="/assets/BL,CMZ_DGcolorCodedRep_B_forBlog.jpg" alt="BL,CMZ"  title="Image series by CMZ, color-coding by BL" align="left" width="25%" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;"> **The cover image** encapsulates my interests of education, neuroscience, and data science.

I have long been interested in education and how people learn. This lead me to neuroscience research with a focus on brain plasticity. One example of this plasticity is shown in the cover image--adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus, a brain structure important for learning and memory. Neuroscience research provided a natural introduction to coding and data science. I am interested in applying data science in education applications.
