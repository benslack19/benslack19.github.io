The cover image of this site shows the ocean. It is a source of tranquility for me. I have spent a lot of time in the ocean as a surfer. I think most who are not familiar with surfing, assume that surfers spend the majority of their time riding waves, like [my profile page](https://benslack19.github.io/about/) shows. In reality, I spend most of my time paddling around, waiting for a wave. When I do try to catch one, I fall often. Surfing is a hobby that I don't ever think I will quite master. Nevertheless, it is an activity that I will continue to do.

Data science and statistics are starting to play a similar role in my life. I am continuously learning. I will make mistakes but I am getting better at recognizing them. But I enjoy the fact that data science can help us make sense of the world around us. That is what keeps me going.
