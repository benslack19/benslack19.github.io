The cover image of this site shows the ocean, a source of tranquility for me. I have spent a lot of time in the ocean as a surfer. I think most who are not familiar with surfing may assume that I spend the majority of my time [riding waves](/assets/surfingBW.png). In reality, I spend most of my session paddling around, waiting for a wave, and trying to catch one. When I do manage to drop in, [I fall often](/assets/FILE0015_fallingBW.png). Surfing requires constant practice. 

Data science and statistics feels similar. I am continuously learning and sometimes I fall. But the equivalent of catching a wave in a data science project is new insight. I know something about the world that I didn't know before. That feeling keeps me going.
