The following are external-facing collateral produced while in my applications and bioinformatics scientist roles. This does not include analysis projects performed internally.


**Single-Cell Stranded Total RNA Sequencing**
The majority of single-cell RNA-seq methods rely on poly-adenylated (poly(A)) capture of RNA. While obtaining messenger RNA is of primary interest, many noncoding RNA and some coding RNA are non-poly-adenylated, suggesting that key molecular mechanisms may be missed. In this project, we adapted a method to be used in our instruments to obtain poly(A) and non-poly(A) RNA at the single-cell level. This provides our customers with a more comprehensive understanding of cellular profiles.

In this project, I developed the full pipeline (starting from FASTQ files) to analyze the data, produced the customer-facing figures, and contributed to the presentation story. My data science tools included bash scripts, and both Python and R for data wrangling and figure generation.

This is now a [launched product](https://www.fluidigm.com/c1openapp/scripthub/script/2018-09/total-rna-seq-1537231959922-5). I presented this work at the [Human Cell Atlas Asia meeting](http://medical-genome.kribb.re.kr/hca/index.html) in South Korea and a colleague presented a poster at the [Single Cell Genomics meeting](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/SCG2018/program) in Cambridge, MA.

**Processing flow-sorted cells for C1 mRNA-seq applications**
Our product, the [C1](https://www.fluidigm.com/products/c1-system), has enabled hundreds of customers to automate single-cell genomics analysis. However, some cells of interest might be sourced from rare tissues or collected from a site where it is logistically challenging to conduct an experiment. Therefore, cryopreservation and flow sorting have become necessary steps upstream of single-cell processing for numerous studies. We evaluated the effect of serum on the recovery of cryopreserved cells prior to processing on the C1.

In this technical note, I produced the customer-facing figures, which includes a regression model, and contributed to authoring the paper. My data science tools were Python packages pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. This technical note is shared with relevant customers to facilitate the success of their experiments.

**Advanta CFTR NGS Library Prep data collateral**
Cystic fibrosis (CF) profiling is a laboratory test common for new parents among certain demographics. We developed a library prepraration assay that increases the scale of samples that can be tested. As part of [product launch](https://www.fluidigm.com/applications/advanta-cftr-ngs), we make available a data pack that demonstrated our analytical validation.

I produced the tables, figures, and was the primary author of the presentation and white paper. My data science tools were Python packages pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. These documents are shared with customers upon request. This is a [launched product](https://www.fluidigm.com/applications/advanta-cftr-ngs). The data collateral is shared with customers of interest.
