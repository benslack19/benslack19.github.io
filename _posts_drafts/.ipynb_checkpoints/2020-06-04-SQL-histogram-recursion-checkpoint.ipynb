From a [Python recursion tutorial](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Recursion/WhatIsRecursion.html), one starts with your input data and recursion shrinks this until a base case is met where the problem can be solved trivially. However in SQL recursion, you start with an \"anchor term\" (which appears analagous to a base case) and uses `UNION` or `UNION ALL` to horizontally concatenate the \"recursive term\" onto the anchor term. Recursion stops adding new rows when a condition is met."
