    "Vectorization and broadcasting are tricks I have used sparingly and absent-mindedly if at all. However, it is a critical skill for algorithmic code to run efficiently, particularly for deep learning networks. While the use of coding libraries have already implemented vectorization and broadcasting, it's good to know how this works. This post was inspired by a lesson in [Andrew Ng's deep learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)."
