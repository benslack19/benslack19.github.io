    "I'm basically a fan-boy of Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking. That's no secret. But I thought it would be prudent to learn more about causal inference and from other sources. I found [Causal Inference with Survey Data](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/causal-inference-with-survey-data/observables-vs-unobservables-causes?u=185169545) on LinkedIn Learning, given by Franz Buscha. I'm using this series of posts to take some notes. In addition, the lectures show some example code in another language (STATA, I believe) and so I thought coding them in Python could reinforce the learning lessons for me."

    "# Introduction of cause and effect\n",
    "- Causal inference matters because it helps distinguish variables that are associations from those that can be causal. It's very common to misunderstand data causality unfortunately.\n",
    "- Experiments are the gold standard because it can be used to control confounding. But experiments can be unethical or impractical in many cases. For example, researchers can't simply force smoking on groups of people. Establishing a link between smoking and lung cancer was done with survey data.- Survey data is often self-reported so it's ripe with biases. American Community Survey is one example of survey data. When using survey data, it's recommended to:\n",
    "    - use probability sampling when possible\n",
    "    - correct biases with weights\n",
    "    - apply techniques for missing data\n",
    "    - ensure survey's topical relevance\n",
    "    - invest time in understanding survey data complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Observables vs. unobservable causes\n",
    "- Variables can be observed in the data but some variables are unboserved, due to lack of measurement or the ability to measure. Personal motivation is something hard to measure for example. But unobserved variables can bias results so they're crucial in causal inference.\n",
    "- Endogeneity: occurs when an explanatory variable is correlated with the error term in a model. It can happen when a variable is left out of a regression model. Thinking about unobserved variables can guide researchers to using better causal techniques.\n",
    "- DAGs help one can better understand causal flow of models. We have to be careful about the presence of backdoor paths between the predictor of interest and the outcome variable.\n"
