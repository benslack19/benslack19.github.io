title: "How to join the Statistical Rethinking cult"
---

[Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) gained a cult following in the last few years. How would I know that? Well, I'm part of the cult.

And I'm not alone. The first version of Solomon Kurz's tidyverse translation starts out unabashed: ["This is a love letter"](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/). This is no doubt due to Dr. McElreath's personality and attitude towards science and statistics. I would liken his appeal to our favorite teachers growing up; you liked he course

The second edition was published just as our lives were 




My journey
- BDA
- mixed effects models, other sources
- found SR
- went back


https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/



“Pre-requisites”
- math knowlege
- computational stuff

Setting up
- language choice
- repos
- sometimes class repo has questions
- choice of video series
    - McElreath’s 2022 lectures are a test of another edition; 2019 is a more faithful and updated to the second edition
- get a hard copy book
- electronic copy
- put it on your phone

Resources
- Follow him on Twitter… follow pymc 
- don't tweet at him as a first pass... he probably gets questions all the time
- Ask on discord, Twitter, etc

Flow / getting through it
Daily
- Order of exposure… lecture, easy book problems, homework, book for details… quizzing... re-watch lecture from different series
- Print out and write notes
- Consistent…. An hour a day (atomic habits)
- Avoid using an answer key…. You’re not going to learn (use code for visualizations, etc)

Weekly / group session
- practice explaining concepts to others
- sometimes you'll get behind, sometimes you'll want to go ahead

- doing a group session
- Draw the owl is necessary 
- once a week, a chapter every 2 weeks
- it'll get harder


Know what to prioritize
- The earlier chapters are fundamental
- Keep the big picture in mind… Know what to skip…  (it depends on what you want to get out of it... skip Gibbs or HMC details... ordererd categorical. )
- Have a personal criteria to move on: “one hard problem”, one homework assignment... easy/medium/hard
- Replay a lecture at faster speed
- Apply to one of your own problems, write a blog post

After finishing the first time
- revisiting past concepts
- going to different sources
- book of why, BDA, gelman and hill, mixtape, etc.

Imperfections
- Some errors?
- Many datasets are small, great teaching examples, not super realistic
- Culture change with others (e.g. mixed effects model)
- T-test/ANOVA teaser
- Open source contributions
