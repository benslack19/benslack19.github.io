    "- Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for causal inference.\n",
    "- Key steps in setting up an RCT:\n",
    "    - Starting with your study sample, randomize assignment to control and treatment arms. The treatment group receives the intervention then the outcome of both control and treatment are studied. Randomization helps account for confounds.\n",
    "    - The conrol group does not receive the intervention, but you can have multiple treatment groups, each with different interventions. In practice, though, most RCTs have only one treatment group.\n",

    "| Method | Description | Key Points | \n",
    "| ----- | ------- | ------- |\n",
    "| Simple randomization  | Assigns equal probability to treatment and control groups |<ul><li>Easy to implement</li><li>Can lead to unequal group sizes in small trials</li> |\n",
    "| Block randomization  | Get similar group sizes by dividing subjects into predetermined number of subjects (often a multiple of the number of groups, like 4, 8, etc. for two groups). Within each block, participants are then randomly assigned to treatment groups.  |<ul><li>Requires choosing the total number of subjects in each block </li><li>Can often avoid imbalance in small trials seen with simple randomization</li> |\n",
    "| Stratified randomization  | Balance based on characteristics/covariates (like age, sex, etc.) before randomizing within these strata |<ul><li>Ensures balance in important covariates between groups  |\n",
    "| Cluster randomization  | Randomizes entire groups (like schools or hospitals) |<ul><li>Suitable for group-level interventions or when individual assignment is impractical   |\n",
    "| Covariate adaptive randomization  | Increases the probability of being assigned to a group to address a deficit of a particular characteristic   within the group |<ul><li>Effective in trials with small sample sizes or multiple important covariates |\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before randomization, the number of observations is typically calculated ahead of time based on a specific effect size (power analysis). You need to consider measure of variability (standard deviation), significance level, and power.\n",
    "- You can make a graph of sample size on y-axis and effect size on x-axis to see the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, causality can be assessed.\n"
